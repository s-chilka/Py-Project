Context: A food business needs to deliver takeouts to the customer in the most efficient manner possible to help maintain proper temperature and reduce the delivery time.
Task: Generate Python code that implements a system through which an algorithm determines the most optimized way of making a takeout delivery to the customer. The following factors need to be taken into consideration:
A business operates ‘n’ number of vehicles for purpose of delivery
It specifies a constraint on the maximum delivery delay per meal. Each delivery to the end customer must satisfy this requirement.
Each delivery endpoint is partitioned into four sectors depending on the direction from where the delivery starts. Example:
NW: Endpoints located Northwest from the delivery center
NE: Endpoints located Northeast from the delivery center
SW: Endpoints located Southwest from the delivery center
SE: Endpoints located Southeast from the delivery center
The input to the system class will be a list of customer deliveries to be made. Example format for each order:
{‘sector’: ‘NW, ‘distance’: 2, ‘order’: 1234, ‘name’: ‘John Doe’, ‘phone’: (921)299-7777, ‘address’: ‘1234 Decatur Way, OR 6691’}
The distance field will indicate either ‘miles’ or ‘km’ based on configuration
A function within the system class will use the ‘sector’, ‘distance’ and the ‘num_vehicles’ fields to implement an algorithm and determine each delivery without violating max_delivery_delay. A warning should be given out for any violation of max delivery delay per meal.
A print statement is needed to indicate which algorithm is being utilized for this purpose.
A list of entries processed needs to be stored in the system class so that functions can access information.
The output of the program will indicate sequential delivery to each endpoint. Separate it out based on Each Vehicle itenary. 
Example:
Start Time: 2.30 pm
S.no	Vehicle Sector Distance Order# Name  Phone        Address     Delivery
1     V1      NW     2        1234   John (921)299-777 1234 Decatur 2.45 pm
: 
1     V2      SE     5        5555   Mary (329)299-777 1234 Broadway 3.00 pm
: 
Return to Base Time:
V1: 3.30 pm
V2: 4:00 pm
Generate at least 20 random test cases to validate program
